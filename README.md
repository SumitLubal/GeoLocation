This is demonstration of how google finds hotels within range...

E.G 
Lets say you have 1000 hotels in city A and someone is standing @ position P and wants to know hotels in range of 3 KM.
With pre data we can check in 1 iteration that how many hotels are in range.

Added:
Generation of random positions around given position with range.
Generation of random poitions outside of range is disabled.
